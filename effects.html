      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Climate change refers to the long-term changes in the Earth's climate, including temperature, precipitation, and sea level. These changes are largely caused by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and trap heat from the sun.</p>
      <p>Climate change is having a significant impact on the planet, affecting everything from wildlife and ecosystems to human health and the global economy. This website explores some of the most significant effects of climate change and what we can do to address them.</p>

      <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
      <p>There are many things you can do to help address climate change, from reducing your energy consumption to supporting policies that promote clean energy and sustainable practices. Explore our resources section to learn more.</p>

          <h2 id="global-temperature-rise">Global Temperature Rise</h2>
          <p>One of the most significant effects of climate change is the rise in global temperatures. The Earth's average temperature has already risen by about 1.2°C (2.2°F) since pre-industrial times, and is projected to continue to rise in the coming decades.</p>
          <p>This increase in temperature is causing a range of impacts, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Melting glaciers and sea ice</li>
            <li>More frequent and intense heatwaves</li>
            <li>Changes in precipitation patterns and droughts</li>
            <li>Increased risk of wildfires</li>
            <li>Loss of biodiversity</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="ocean-acidification">Ocean Acidification</h2>
          <p>1.Ocean acidification is a process that occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) is absorbed by seawater, which results in a decrease in pH levels and an increase in acidity.</p>
        </br>
           <p> 2.The main cause of ocean acidification is the release of CO2 into the atmosphere by human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.</p>
        </br> 
            <p>3.As the ocean becomes more acidic, it can have significant impacts on marine life, including reduced growth rates, decreased ability to form shells or skeletons, and changes in behavior.</p>
        </br> 
           <p> 4.The impact of ocean acidification can have serious consequences on marine ecosystems and the food chain, affecting the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on the ocean for food and income.</p>
          <h2 id="sea-level-rise">Sea level rise</h2>
          <p>1.Sea levels have been rising at an accelerating rate over the past century, and the current rate of sea level rise is faster than at any time in the past 2,000 years.</p>
        </br>
           <p> 2.Sea level rise is caused by the warming of the planet, which causes glaciers and ice sheets to melt and the oceans to expand as they absorb heat.</p>
        </br>
            <p>3.Coastal areas around the world are already experiencing the impacts of sea level rise, including more frequent and severe coastal flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into groundwater.</p>
        </br>
            <p>4.Some low-lying island nations and coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of sea level rise, and may face the prospect of becoming uninhabitable in the coming decades.</p>
           <h2 id="extreme-weather-events">Extreme Weather Events</h2> 
           <p>1.Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, caused by the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by human activities such as burning fossil fuels.</p>
        </br>
            <p>2.Some examples of extreme weather events include heatwaves, droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, and thunderstorms.</p>
    </br>
            <p>3.Extreme weather events can have serious impacts on human health, causing heat stroke, respiratory illness, and other health problems. They can also damage infrastructure, homes, and businesses, and disrupt transportation and communication networks.</p>
</br>
           <p> 4.Climate change is also exacerbating the impacts of extreme weather events, such as by increasing the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons, and by causing sea levels to rise and coastal areas to be inundated by storm surges.</p>
