            <h2>Greenhouse Gases</h2>
            <p>One of the primary causes of climate change is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p><p> These gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun and cause the Earth's temperature to rise. </p><p>The burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Deforestation</h2>
            <p>Deforestation, or the cutting down of forests, is another major contributor to climate change.</p><p> Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, so when they are cut down, the carbon they store is released into the air.</p><p> Deforestation also reduces the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide, creating a cycle of even more emissions.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Transportation</h2>
            <p>The transportation sector is a significant contributor to climate change, as vehicles emit greenhouse gases during their operation.</p><p> Cars and trucks are the largest source of transportation emissions, but airplanes, ships, and trains also contribute to the problem.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
            <h2>Burning Fossil Fuels</h2>
            <p>Burning fossil fuels for energy is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and is a significant cause of climate change.</p>
            </section>
           
            <section>
            <h2>Agriculture</h2>
            <p>Agriculture, particularly livestock farming, generates large amounts of methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas and contributes significantly to climate change.</p>
